# Polygol
Ambient OS-like dashboard with clock, weather and advanced features without tracking you or displaying ads.

# Gurapp Applications
Gurapp can extend your Gurasuraisu experience. The GitHub repository for each application are seperate from the `polygol.github.io` GitHub repository.

# Running Locally
Applications: You must download the Gurapps from each GitHub repository and place them in the root directory in order for Gurapps to work correctly with Gurasuraisu locally.
Assets: You must edit the directory path in the code, since every path assumes that the asset is in root.
